#FAQ

**How come my commits are not connected to my Github account?**

Since we are not using your Github credentials, you are committing with the email you signed up to Enki with. You can connect this to your account by adding the email you signed up to Enki with to your Github.

**Okay, I'm using the right email address! But commits are not appearing on my Github streak or profile. Why?**

Due to Github's policies you'll have to 'Star' the repo for your contributions to appear in your streak. Read more here: [Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile? - Github](https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/)
